### Define the concepts of SIEM, SOAR, XDR

- SIEM: A SIEM system is a tool that an organization uses to collect data from across the whole estate, including infrastructure, software, and resources. It does analysis, looks for correlations or anomalies, and generates alerts and incidents.
- SOAR: A SOAR system takes alerts from many sources, such as a SIEM system. The SOAR system then triggers action-driven automated workflows and processes to run security tasks that mitigate the issue.
- XDR: An XDR system is designed to deliver intelligent, automated, and integrated security across an organizationâ€™s domain. It helps prevent, detect, and respond to threats across identities, endpoints, applications, email, IoT, infrastructure, and cloud platforms.

### Describe how Sentinel provides integrated threat protection

- Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native SIEM/SOAR solution that delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise. It provides a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.
