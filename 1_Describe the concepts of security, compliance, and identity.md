## Describe security and compliance concepts


### Shared responsibility model

[Describe the shared responsibility model - Learn | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/3-describe-shared-responsibility-model)

This model identifies which security tasks are handled by the cloud provider, and which are handled by customers. 

- On-premises - Organisation own 100% of responsibilities for Security and Compliance
- Cloud-based - Shared between customer and the cloud provider.

![The Shared responsibility model responsibilities by type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/wwl-sci/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/media/3-shared-responsibility-model-responsibilites-type.png)

**Customer**,

- Owns **data and identities**.
- Is responsible for protecting the security of **data and identities**.


**Summary**

Responsibility is always retained by the customer organisation include,

- Information and Data
- Devices (Mobile and PCs)
- Accounts and Identities 

*In a shared responsibility model*, a layered approach to security is illustrated as: 

- For **on-premises solutions**, the customer is both accountable and responsible for all  aspects of security and operations.
- For **IaaS solutions**, the elements such as buildings, servers, networking hardware, and the  hypervisor should be managed by the platform vendor. The customer is responsible or  has a shared responsibility for securing and managing the operating system, network  configuration, applications, identity, clients, and data.
- For **PaaS solutions** build on IaaS deployments, and the provider is additionally responsible to  manage and secure the network controls. The customer is still responsible or has a  shared responsibility for securing and managing applications, identity, clients, and data.  
- For **SaaS solutions**, a vendor provides the application and abstracts customers from the  underlying components. Nonetheless, the customer continues to be accountable; they  must ensure that data is classified correctly, and they share a responsibility to manage  their users and end-point devices.   

The importance of understanding this shared responsibility model is essential for customers who  are moving to the cloud. **Cloud providers offer considerable advantages for security and  compliance efforts, but these advantages do not absolve the customer from protecting their  users, applications, and service offerings.**

### Defence in Depth

[Describe defense in depth - Learn | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/4-describe-defense-depth)

Defence in depth uses a layered approach to security, rather than relying on a single perimeter. 

A defence in-depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack. Each layer provides protection so that, if one layer is breached, a subsequent layer will prevent an attacker getting unauthorized access to data.

Example layers of security might include:

- **Physical** security such as limiting access to a datacentre to only authorized personnel.
- **Identity and access** security controlling access to infrastructure and change control.
- **Perimeter** security including distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.
- **Network** security can limit communication between resources using segmentation and access controls.
- The **compute** layer can secure access to virtual machines either on-premises or in the cloud by closing certain ports.
- **Application** layer security ensures that applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
- **Data** layer security controls access to business and customer data, and encryption to protect data.

### Zero-Trust Methodology

[Describe the zero-trust methodology - Learn | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/2-describe-zero-trust-methodology)

Assumes everything is on an open untrusted network. This model operates on **Trust no one, verify everything**. Putting this model in practice means, we no longer assume that a password is sufficient to validate a user, additional checks must be provided to prove identity like multi-factor authentication. Users are allowed only to the specific application or data they need.

#### Zero Trust Guiding Principals

- **Verify explicitly**
  - Always authenticate and authorise based on the available data points like Identity, Location, Device, Service or Workload, Data classification and Anomalies 
- **Least privileged access**
  - Limit access by JIT (**J**ust **I**n **T**ime) and **J**ust **E**nough **A**ccess (JEA)
  - Risk based adaptive policies
  - Data Protection, protecting both Data and Productivity
- **Assume breach**
  - Segment access by network, user devices and application.
  - User encryption to protect data.
  - Use of analysis to get visibility, detect threats and improve security.

#### Foundational Pillars

These six pillars work together with the Zero Trust model to enforce organisation security policies.

- **Identities**
- **Devices**
- **Applications**
- **Data**
- **Infrastructure**
- **Networks**


#### Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)

- All three sides of the CIA model are important and they also represent trade-offs that need to be made.

![Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/wwl-sci/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/media/4-confidentiality-integrity-availability.png)



## <u>Common Threats</u>

[Describe common threats - Learn | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/5-describe-common-threats)

- **Data breach**
  
  - When some data is stolen, which involves personal data (data/information which can relate to identify an individual directly or indirectly)
- **Dictionary attack**
  - Type of an identity attack where a hacker attempts to steal an identity by trying a large number of known passwords.
  - *Passwords are tried against a known username.*
  - This attacks are also known as **Brute Force Attacks**.
- **Ransomware**
  - Type of a malware that encrypts files and folders, preventing access to important files.
  - These attacks attempts to extort money from victims, usually in the form of cryptocurrencies, in the exchange of decryption key.
- **Disruptive attacks**
  - A **D**istributed **D**enial **o**f **S**ervice (DDoS) attack attempts to exhaust an application's resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
  - These types of attacks can be targeted at any endpoints which are publicly reachable through Internet.

- **Other types**

  - Coin Miners

  - Rootkits

    - These attacks intercept and change standard Operating System processes.
    - Once a device is infected with these type of an attack, reports coming from the devices can not be trusted.

  - Trojans

    - Type of malware, which can not spread on their own.
    - Either they have to be downloaded manually or another malware needs to download and install them.
    - Trojan uses the same file name as real and legitimate apps, so it's easy for a user to accidentally download instead.

  -  Worms

    - Type of malware, which can copy itself and spread through a network by exploiting vulnerabilities.
    - Usually spreads through e-mail attachment, text messages, file sharing programs, social networking sites, network shares, removable drive etc.

  - Exploits and Exploit Kits.

    

## Encryption and Hashing

[Describe ways encryption hashing and signing can secure your data - Learn | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/6-describe-ways-encryption-hashing-signing-secure-data)

Process of making data unreadable and unusable to unauthorised viewers. To be able to use or read encrypted data, it has to be decrypted, which requires use of a secret key.

Encryption can protect data at rest or in transit.

### Two types of top-level encryption

- #### Symmetric

  - Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data.

- #### Asymmetric

  - Uses public key and private key pair, either key can encrypt data but a single key can't be used to decrypt encrypted data.
  - Usually used for things like Transport Layer Security (TLS), HTTPS protocol and data signing.

### Encryption at rest

- Data at rest is data stored on a physical device like Server(s).
- It may be stored in database or Storage Account but, regardless of the device it is stored on, encryption of data at rest ensues the data is unreadable without the necessary keys and secrets to decrypt.

### Encryption in transit

- Data in transit is, the data moving from one location to another.
- This can be archived by encrypting the data at the Application layer before sending it over a network.
- Example of this type of encryption, **HTTPS**

### Hashing

- Hashing uses an algorithm to convert the original text to a *unique* fixed-length hash value. Each time the same text is hashed using the same algorithm, the same hash value is produced. That hash can then be used as a unique identifier of its associated data.

- Hashing is different to encryption in that it doesn't use keys, and the hashed value isn't subsequently decrypted back to the original.

- Hashing is used to store passwords. When a user enters their password, the same algorithm that created the stored hash creates a hash of the entered password. This is compared to the stored hashed version of the password. If they match, the user has entered their password correctly. This is more secure than storing plain text passwords, but hashing algorithms are also known to hackers. Because hash functions are deterministic (the same input produces the same output), hackers can use brute-force dictionary attacks by hashing the passwords. For every matched hash, they know the actual password. 
- To mitigate this risk, passwords are often **salted**. This refers to adding a fixed-length random value to the input of hash functions to create unique hashes for every input. As hackers can't know the salt value, the hashed passwords are more secure.

### Signing

![A private key generates the signature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/wwl-sci/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/media/6-private-key-generates-signature.png)

There are two steps involved in creating a digital signature from a message. First, a hash value is created from the message. In the second step, the hash value is signed, using the signer's private key, as illustrated below:

![The message is hashed using a hashing algorithm, then signed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/wwl-sci/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/media/6-hashed-using-hash-algorithm.png)

At the receiving end, the message is hashed again, and verified against the digital signature, which is decrypted using the public key.

![The hash value is verified against the signature using signer’s public key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/wwl-sci/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/media/6-hash-value-verified.png)
